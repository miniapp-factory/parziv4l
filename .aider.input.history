+Code the following app
+```
+Here is your **FINAL PROMPT** — perfectly structured for the OpenxAI Mini App Factory to generate the full app cleanly, with maximum scoring for Functionality, Idea Quality, and UX.
+
+---
+
+# ✅ **FINAL MINI APP PROMPT (Copy & Paste This)**
+
+**Build a single-page “ACD Student Assistant” Mini App with multiple tools designed to help students manage their school life.
+The app must NOT use external dependencies, CDNs, or APIs.
+All features should run offline using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
+Use buttons or tabs to switch between modules.
+The UI must be clean, organized, modern, and mobile-friendly.**
+
+---
+
+# **🟦 REQUIRED MODULES**

+## **1. Class Schedule Builder**
+
+* Inputs: Subject Name, Day, Time, Room
+* “Add Subject” button
+* Display entries in a table
+* Allow deleting individual subjects
+* “Clear All” button
+* Use simple form validation
+
+---
+
+## **2. Grade Calculator**
+
+* User can add multiple subjects with their score
+* Automatically calculate:
+
+  * Average
+  * Equivalent grade (simple scale: 90+ = Excellent, 80–89 = Good, etc.)
+  * Pass/Fail
+* Display results inside a styled card
+* Allow deleting entries
+
+---
+
+## **3. Attendance Tracker**
+
+* Input: Student name
+* Three buttons: **Present**, **Absent**, **Late**
+* Each press updates the counts for that student
+* Display a summary list of all students with their counts
+* Allow resetting individual students or clearing all records
+
+---
+
+## **4. Study Planner / To-Do List**
+
+* Input: Task name
+* Dropdown categories: **School**, **Personal**, **Exams**
+* “Add Task” button
+* Show tasks grouped by category
+* Checkbox to mark tasks as completed
+* Completed tasks move to a separate section
+* “Clear Completed” and “Clear All” buttons
+
+---
+
+## **5. Random Quiz Generator**
+
+* User inputs a topic and a list of items (one per line)
+* When starting the quiz:
+
+  * Randomly generate questions using the items
+  * 5–10 questions per quiz
+  * Timer (countdown) display
+  * Track score
+* Show final score summary
+* Include a “Try Again” button
+
+---
+
+# **🟩 GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS**
+
+* Use only built-in HTML/CSS/JS
+* No internet access, no external libraries
+* Clean tabbed or button-based navigation
+* Simple, student-friendly design
+* All modules appear inside one page, not separate pages
+* Components should use cards, tables, lists, or dialogs
+* Make the interface intuitive and accessible
+* Add clear labels, spacing, and section headers
+
+---
+
+# **🟧 LAYOUT INSTRUCTIONS**
+
+* At the top: a horizontal menu with buttons for each module
+
+  * Schedule
+  * Grades
+  * Attendance
+  * Planner
+  * Quiz
+* Clicking a button switches the visible module
+* Only one module is visible at a time
+* Use smooth transitions when switching sections
+
+---
+
+# **🟥 FINAL BEHAVIOR**
+
+* Everything should work instantly with no page reload
+* All logic handled in JavaScript
+* Use arrays/objects in memory for data
+* Reset buttons must properly clear data
+* The app should be visually clean and easy to use
+
+---
+
+If you want, I can also make you:
+
+✅ A **pitch description** (for judges)
+✅ A **sample UI mockup**
+✅ **Improvements** you can do after the base app is generated
+
+Just tell me!
+
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
